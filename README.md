# mySQLMOOC
MySQL MOOC Challenge
This was my first ever CFG mini MOOC Challenge.  During the course of the 4 weeks I found mySQL so engaging that I worked with like minded people on the challenge.  Not only was this my first step towards coding but it also meant I was able to investigate more into the coding world and meet like minded people.  I worked with some strong females and we worked together to pull together our MOOC and present our assignment.
Having meetings with people from different areas of the globe allowed me to truly see the accessible nature of the coding sector.
Within this project we all worked together on creating the coding data, analysis questions and a PPT to showcase how we worked together.
